title: Hi, I'm Peter Snow.

I'm a **web developer** from Sydney, Australia.

I enjoy working on challenging problems, and building things that make life easier for others.

I'm a big fan of the core technologies of the open web: vanilla **Javascript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

Recently my focus has been on using **React**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL** to build full featured web apps.

Currently, I'm a student at [Launch School](https://www.launchschool.com), where I'm solidifying my understanding of software engineering from the ground up.

One of my aspirations is to help others learn to code. I like to write [tutorials and articles](/blog) to encourage new developers with tips, techniques, and concepts that have been helpful to me on my journey.
